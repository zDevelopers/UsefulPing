# UsefulPing ![Build & Test](https://github.com/zDevelopers/UsefulPing/workflows/Build%20&%20Test/badge.svg)

An useful and lightweight `/ping` command with latency and server load, for Bukkit. [Download link](https://jenkins.carrade.eu/job/UsefulPing/).

```
/ping            — displays own ping
/ping <player>   — displays ping for this player

Aliases: /lag, /latency
```

Permission: `ping.ping` (default `true`).

## Diagnostics

If the latency or server load is high, the command displays a diagnostic to help the player understand
its performances problems.

Permission: `ping.diagnostic` (default `true`).

## Monitoring

By using `/toggleping` (or clicking on “keep displayed” in the `/ping` output), the ping can be kept
displayed above the inventory, on the action bar. That can be useful to monitor your connection, if
it is bad, or the server performances.

Permission: `ping.toggleping` (default `true`).
